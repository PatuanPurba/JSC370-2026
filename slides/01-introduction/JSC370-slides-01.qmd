---

## What is data science?

- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

## What do data scientists actually do?

- Frame a question and define success (what would convince you?)
- Acquire data (files, databases, APIs, scraping)
- Clean + validate (units, missingness, duplicates, joins)
- Explore (EDA) → iterate → refine hypotheses
- Model + evaluate (prediction, inference, uncertainty)
- Communicate results (reports, dashboards, reproducible code)

---


## Data Scientists have great responsibility to communicate effectively

Source: https://xkcd.com/605/

---

## Why communication matters in Data Science

- Opaque models without uncertainty estimation or discussion of limitations
- Biased or unrepresentative data may lead to biased predictions
- Confounding $\ne$ causation (EDA can sometimes mislead)
- Overfitting and weak validation 
- Commentary on Data Science: [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/editors-pick/)

## Top Job Titles

## Data Scientists in Demand

- Demand for data science skills is high across many sectors.
- Skills show up again and again:
  - Python + libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn)
  - SQL + relational thinking (joins, grouping)
  - Visualization + storytelling (matplotlib/plotline/plotly)
  - Reproducibility (git, environments, reports)
  - Communication (clear write-ups, assumptions, limitations)

---

## Global labor market outlook 

World Economic Forum (Future of Jobs Report 2025) projects that by **2030**:

- **170 million** roles created (across the labor market)
- **92 million** roles displaced
- **Net +78 million** jobs (**~7%** net growth)

These totals reflect *all* occupations (not just AI). Data/AI roles show up when we look at the **fastest-growing job families**. Source: [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/digest/)

---

## Which jobs are growing fastest?

Fastest-growing roles (percentage terms) include:

- **Big Data Specialists**
- **AI and Machine Learning Specialists**
- **FinTech Engineers**
- **Software and Application Developers**  


---

## The data behind the plot

| Quantity | Value (millions) |
|---|---:|
| Jobs created | 170 |
| Jobs displaced | 92 |
| Net change | 78 |


---


## Visualization of these data

```{pyodide}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
labels = ["Jobs created", "Jobs displaced", "Net change"]
vals = [170, 92, 78]  # WEF article summary
plt.figure()
plt.bar(labels, vals)
plt.ylabel("Millions of jobs")
plt.title("Projected global job changes by 2030 (WEF)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## What is this course?

This course is an introduction to the world of data science following on from where JSC270 left off.

We will focus on **transferable** skills and modern workflows:

- **Python + VS Code** for computing
- **Quarto** for reproducible reports/slides
- **Git/GitHub** for version control and collaboration

---

## What you should expect

- Weekly labs and bi-weekly homework using Python + Quarto
- Submissions via GitHub Classroom (version control matters)
- Focus on reproducibility: clean repos, clear reports, runnable code
- Collaboration encouraged for discussion, but write-ups/code must be your own

---


## Data Science Resources: Python

- **[Python for Data Analysis (3e)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)** — Wes McKinney  
  - Focus: **pandas + NumPy + Jupyter** for data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis  
  - Good for: practical workflows and “how to do it in pandas”

- **[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)** — Jake VanderPlas  
  - Focus: core stack **NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib**, plus intro ML tooling  
  - Bonus: full text is online and backed by notebooks [GitHub notebooks repo](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)**

---

## Python and VS Code

- **Python**: general-purpose language widely used for data science
- **VS Code**: a lightweight, extensible editor with strong Python + notebook support

::: {.fragment}
![](img/VS-code-screen.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}
:::

---

## What is VS Code?

- An editor for **code, notebooks, and markdown**
- Works well with:
  - Python environments (conda/venv)
  - Jupyter notebooks
  - Connecting to remote environments (e.g. Digital Alliance Canada, AWS)
  - Git/GitHub
  - Quarto render/preview

---

## VS Code: Things you’ll use every week

- Select the correct Python environment
- Integrated terminal (run `quarto render`, `git`, `ssh`)
- Source control panel (stage/commit/push)
- Quarto preview for slides/reports

---

## VS Code: Layout

## Quarto and Python and VS Code
- **Quarto**: markdown-based publishing for reports, sites, and slides

---

## How does Quarto work?

::: {.fragment}
![](img/quarto-flow.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}
:::
- You write a single source file (`.qmd`) that mixes **text**, **code**, and **output options** (YAML + chunk options).
- Quarto executes code (e.g., Python via Jupyter) and captures **tables, figures, and printed output**.
- It renders the document through **Pandoc** into a chosen format (HTML report, reveal.js slides, PDF, Word, etc.).
- The final output is a **self-contained deliverable** (e.g., `report.html`) that can be shared or published.

---


## Generating reports with Quarto

- A Quarto document is a plain-text file with extension **`.qmd`**.
- At the top is a **YAML header** that controls metadata and output (title, author, date, format, options).
- The `format` field determines what Quarto produces:
  - `html` → a web report (`.html`)
  - `pdf` → a PDF report (LaTeX installed)
  - `docx` → a Word document
  - `revealjs` → slides

---

## Generating reports with Quarto

An example yaml header for an html report

```yaml
---
title: "My Report"
format: html
---
```

- Rendering turns `MyReport.qmd` into `MyReport.html` (and supporting files if needed).
- Core command: `quarto render MyReport.qmd`

---


## Quarto code chunks

A code chunk might look like this:

![](img/quarto-codechunk.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

---

## Quarto code chunks

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])
plt.show()
```

---

## Quarto code chunks

Preamble (options):

`echo`: show/hide code

`eval`: run or skip

`fig-width` / `fig-height`: control plot size

---

## Quarto Code chunks and options

Code:

`import`: libraries

`.plot`, `.show`: make figures and display them

---


## GitHub

- Version control is essential in industry and academia
- Building a GitHub portfolio supports job hunting
- You will build a **github.io** website as part of this course, with interactivity and app-type features

## Git vs GitHub

- **Git**: version control tool on your computer
- **GitHub**: hosting + collaboration (remote repos, PRs, issues)
- Workflow: edit → commit (git) → push (to GitHub)

---


## This week: checklist

- Install Python + VS Code + Quarto
- Clone your GitHub Classroom repo
- Render a `.qmd` locally
- Commit + push your changes
- Lab will be on your own this week, starting in person next week, January 14!

---

## Next Week

- Lecture: Monday January 12, 1–3pm (Version control)
- Lab: Wednesday January 14, 1–3pm (VS Code, Python, Quarto, GitHub)
