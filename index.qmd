### Course Description

This course serves as the second in a series of courses on data science. We will focus on the acquisition and analysis of real-life data. Students will learn the toolsets needed to 1) create workable and reproducible data by accessing, scraping, sampling and cleaning data; 2) conduct exploratory data analysis and data visualizations; 3) apply statistical and machine learning tools to learn from data; 4) conduct computing on remote systems. Python, VS Code, Quarto, and GitHub will be used.

### Grading Breakdown

| Task  | % of Grade |
|---|---|
|Labs (including attendance and guest speaker reflections)|15|
|Homework (5)|25|
|Midterm report|25|
|Final project|35|

* Homework: There will be 5 homeworks given throughout the semester. Students may discuss the problems with one another; however, individual solutions must be submitted and copying will not be tolerated. All homework must be completed in Quarto (.qmd) using Python code chunks, and submitted through the course GitHub Classroom. Late assignments will be penalized by 10% per day past the due date.

* Midterm Project: A mid-semester report detailing the dataset you will use for the final project. Exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and summaries of the data will be presented.

* Final Project: Apply the concepts learned in the course to analyze a dataset that you have chosen. Create and deploy a GitHub website with interactive components.

* Labs: Lab attendance and participation is required and counts toward the overall lab grade. The lab assignment will be handed in at the end of the lab (or by the end of the lab day if more time is needed). The lowest lab grade will be dropped in calculating your final grade.
